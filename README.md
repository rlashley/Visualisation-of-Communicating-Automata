# Visualisation-of-Communicating-Automata
My Msc Project

This project is my Msc Project and will be continually updated over the summer of 2018. 

The project in its end state will generate and show multiple automata communicating. They will generate using a formatted
text file that tells the software what machines to generate, what states they should begin, and what messages they can send.

Feel free to ask any questions about what I am doing or if you have some advice, I'd be glad to hear how I can improve.
